# Simple Strategy Game

## Overview

This is a turn-based strategy game inspired by classics like Civilization, Total War: Warhammer, Risk, and Age of Empires. Players gather resources, expand territories, construct buildings, and engage in tactical combat in a pixel-art, top-down world. The ultimate goal: conquer your opponentâ€™s Townhall.

With its **Client (UI)** and **Server (GameState)** architecture, the game is designed for local play against an AI or another player, with future extensibility for networked multiplayer.

## Core Gameplay Features

1. **Resource Management**  
   Gather resources like food, wood, gold, and stone by constructing specialized buildings. These resources are essential for territorial expansion, army deployment, and sustaining your empire.  

2. **Territorial Expansion**  
   Start with a single tile and grow by colonizing neutral tiles or conquering enemy ones. Each additional tile increases resource demands, encouraging thoughtful strategy.  

3. **Building Construction**  
   Place buildings on owned tiles to generate resources or other bonuses. Balancing expansion with resource upkeep is key to success.  

4. **Combat**  
   Deploy armies to protect your territories or invade opponents. Strategic positioning and resource planning are critical in battle.  

5. **Custom Maps**  
   Use the map editor to design your own battlegrounds, save them as text files, and challenge your friends.

## Testing

Thorough testing is integrated into the build process to validate each main class. The tests ensure the correctness, stability, and functionality of the code.  

### Running Tests
1. **Build Tests**  
   Run the following command from the `build` directory:  
   ```bash
   make
   ```
2. **Execute Tests**  
   Use `ctest` to run all tests:  
   ```bash
   ctest
   ```
   The tests automatically validate core functionalities such as resource management, combat, and building mechanics. Individual test files are located in the `tests` directory.
